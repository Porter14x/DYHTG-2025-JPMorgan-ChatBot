Hello

In short: you choose your goal and risk level, pick an investment style, and Nutmeg builds and manages a globally diversified portfolio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to match that.
How do you invest with Nutmeg?
Here’s how it works: We get to know you – You tell us your goal (e.g., first home, retirement), how much you want to invest, and your risk appetite. Choose an investment style – You pick from options like Fully Managed, Thematic, etc., based on how involved you want to be and what mix you want. Leave it to us – We build and manage a portfolio of ETFs (over 1,800 ETFs considered) that’s globally diversified, actively monitored and rebalanced in line with our investment philosophy (global perspective, diversification, cost control, transparency, liquidity). We’ll keep you informed about what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and how your portfolio is performing — you can view it via our app or dashboard.
What investment styles are available and how do they differ?
Nutmeg offers several investment styles tailored to different goals and risk appetites. Here are a few: Fully Managed: Your portfolio is actively managed by the investment team — they monitor global markets, economic data and adjust the portfolio accordingly. Fixed Allocation: A simpler, lower-cost style where the portfolio is set at outset and rebalanced automatically with minimal intervention. Thematic Investing: Allows you to choose one of several future-focused themes (e.g., technological innovation, resource transformation, evolving consumer behaviour) and your portfolio is tilted towards that theme while remaining globally diversified. Higher risk. Smart Alpha (powered by J.P. Morgan Asset Management): A more actively managed style leveraging research from J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Socially Responsible Investing (SRI): Focuses on companies with strong environmental, social and governance credentials, while still aiming for growth. Income Investing: An option for investors seeking a regular income stream (via dividends) in addition to growth — uses J.P. Morgan expertise. Each style has trade-offs between cost, involvement, risk and potential return, so we help you choose what fits your goals and comfort-level.
What are the key investment principles Nutmeg follows?
Nutmeg’s investment philosophy is built on clear principles: Maintain a global perspective to maximise the opportunity set and investment universe.
Focus on diversification to balance medium-term rewards and risk. Rebalance regularly to keep portfolios aligned with long-term objectives. Keep costs and fees proportionate so clients benefit from better net returns. Provide transparency in performance and holdings, offering clarity throughout the investment journey.
Allow access to capital by investing in liquid assets that are easy to buy and sell, with transparent fees. In practice, this means the portfolios are built primarily using ETFs, which offer efficiency, transparency and liquidity.
What are the risks I should know about when investing with Nutmeg?
As with all investing, there are risks. A few key things:
Your capital is at risk — the value of your portfolio can go down as well as up, and you may get back less than you invest. Tax treatment depends on your individual circumstances and may change. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. Some styles (for example Thematic or Income Investing) carry additional risks because of their tilt towards specific themes or dividend strategies. Because portfolios are built via ETFs and global assets, they will be exposed to currency risk, market risk, sector risk, and also how global macro-factors evolve.
We recommend you choose a risk level appropriate to you, ensure your goal, time-horizon and financial situation are aligned, and if in doubt consider seeking advice.
Can you explain what a Lifetime ISA is and how Nutmeg uses it?
Certainly. A Lifetime ISA (LISA) is a UK government-backed product designed to help people aged between 18 and 39 save for their first home or retirement. 
Here are the key points:
You can contribute up to £4,000 per tax year into a stocks & shares LISA. 
The government will add a 25% bonus on your contributions (so you could get up to £1,000 per year on £4,000) provided you meet the rules. For first-time home purchase: you can use the LISA for a first home up to £450,000 value. For retirement: you can withdraw from the LISA without penalty after age 60. However, if you withdraw for other reasons you’ll incur a 25% penalty (so you could get back less than you invested). Nutmeg offers a Stocks & Shares Lifetime ISA (they do not currently offer a cash LISA) where they invest your money into their portfolios based on your risk‐profile and chosen style. It’s important to check whether a LISA or your pension plan is more suitable for your circumstances (for example employer pension match may be more beneficial).
What does ‘diversification’ mean in Nutmeg’s portfolios?
Diversification is a key part of how Nutmeg builds portfolios. It means spreading your investments across many different assets, sectors, countries and types of investment, so that you are not overly exposed to any one company, market or risk-factor. In practice, Nutmeg uses exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which themselves hold many underlying securities. They review over 1,800 ETFs when constructing portfolios. By diversifying globally and across asset-classes (equities, bonds, commodities, specialist sectors) and rebalancing regularly, the aim is to balance risk and reward over the long term.
What fees will I pay when investing with Nutmeg?
Nutmeg uses a clear three-part fee structure: A management fee which depends on your investment style and portfolio size. For example, for many styles the annual management fee is 0.75% of the first £100,000 and 0.35% on amounts above £100,000. Underlying investment fund charges (for ETFs etc) which are absorbed within your portfolio. Market spread costs – the difference between buy and sell prices when investing. You can view the detailed breakdown of your fees in your dashboard at any time.
Is there a minimum investment amount with Nutmeg?
Yes – for many of Nutmeg’s account types you’ll typically need at least £500 to open a Stocks & Shares ISA, General Investment Account (GIA) or pension. For a Lifetime ISA or Junior ISA the minimum can be as low as £100.
How does Nutmeg assess my risk appetite?
When you sign up, Nutmeg asks you to complete a risk-questionnaire to identify your risk appetite and time horizon. Based on your risk level (on a scale from 1 to 10 in many portfolios) your portfolio will be built accordingly.
What does risk level 1 versus risk level 10 mean?
In Nutmeg’s Fully Managed portfolios, risk levels represent the mix of higher-risk assets (equities) vs lower-risk assets (bonds) in your portfolio. At risk level 1, most investments will be in government bonds, money market or corporate bonds; only a small share in equities (and mostly from developed markets). At risk level 10, most exposure will be to equities (including emerging markets like China, Brazil), with limited bond exposure. It’s important to remember: higher risk may offer higher returns over time but also greater potential for loss.
Can I change my investment style or risk level later on?
Yes. Nutmeg’s process is designed to be flexible: you can change your investment style or risk profile at any time through your account. Tracking and rebalancing will then reflect your new settings.
What is the ‘Fixed Allocation’ style in Nutmeg and how does it differ?
The Fixed Allocation style is a lower-cost option where your portfolio is set at outset according to your risk level and then automatically rebalanced by technology. Unlike more actively managed styles, the investment team only monitors once per year in many cases, making the fees lower.
What is Thematic Investing with Nutmeg?
Thematic Investing allows you to pick one of several future-focused themes (such as technological innovation, resource transformation, evolving consumer behaviour) and your portfolio is tilted towards that theme while still being globally diversified. Note: This style is only available for risk levels 5 and above.
What is the Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) style?
In Nutmeg’s SRI style, your portfolio is invested in companies that meet certain environmental, social and governance criteria, while still aiming for long-term growth.
What is Income Investing in Nutmeg?
Income Investing is a style where your aim is to receive regular income (dividends) from your investments, alongside growth. It’s managed using the expertise of J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Note: Income isn’t guaranteed and may fluctuate.
How does Nutmeg build and manage my portfolio?
Nutmeg uses a globally diversified approach, primarily via low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to gain exposure to many assets in one fund. The process: They get to know you (goals, risk). They build your portfolio tailored to your goal and risk profile. They keep you informed and manage/ rebalance your portfolio over time.”,
Why is global diversification important in Nutmeg’s philosophy?
Nutmeg emphasises diversification to spread risk across asset-classes, geographies and sectors. Using ETFs with global exposure and rebalancing helps aim for more stable long-term risk-adjusted returns.
What happens in periods of market volatility — does Nutmeg adjust?
Yes – Nutmeg’s investment team monitors market conditions and adjusts portfolios as needed. However, many clients stay invested through volatile periods. For example: during several past market stress events, about 97.8% of Nutmeg investors did not make changes to their portfolios. That said, markets are unpredictable and past behaviour is not a guarantee of future performance.
Are my investments safe with Nutmeg? What are the risks?
There is no guarantee of positive returns and you may get back less than you invest. Key risk points: Your capital is at risk – portfolio values can go down as well as up. 
Changes in tax treatment could affect results. Although bonds historically have lower volatility than equities, they may underperform or also fall in some conditions (e.g., rising interest rates) so diversification doesn’t eliminate risk.Some investment styles like Thematic or Income carry additional risk due to their focused nature.”,
How do I withdraw or transfer my money from Nutmeg?
In many cases you can withdraw money without exit fees. For example, Stocks & Shares ISAs and GIA accounts allow withdrawals. For Lifetime ISAs or pensions, withdrawal is subject to government rules. Transfers ‘in specie’ (moving investments rather than selling) can incur a charge (e.g., £20 per “line of stock”)
What can I do if I want guidance or advice from Nutmeg?
Nutmeg offers free financial guidance from their team to help you decide suitable styles and goals. For more comprehensive regulated advice, there is a fee-based service.
What does ‘capital at risk’ mean in practice for my Nutmeg portfolio?
This means that the value of your portfolio can go down as well as up, and you may get back less than you invested. This is inherent to investing. Nutmeg emphasises this in its disclosures. It’s important to align your goal, time-horizon and risk tolerance accordingly.
What is the fee break-down for different investment styles (example)?
Here’s an illustrative breakdown: For a typical “Fully Managed” portfolio under £100k: 0.75% annual management fee. For a “Fixed Allocation” portfolio under £100k: 0.45% annual management fee. Once a portfolio goes above £100k in value, the fee rate may drop (for example 0.35% on amounts above £100k in many styles) to give economies of scale. Additionally, you’ll incur fund costs and market spread costs on top of the management fee.
If I open multiple ‘pots’ for different goals, how does Nutmeg handle them?
You can create multiple ‘pots’ in Nutmeg (for example one for retirement, one for a first home, one for a child). Each pot can have its own goal, risk level and investment style. The management fee is applied according to your combined portfolio and style types.
What happens if I later decide to move out of a higher-risk style because I’m approaching my goal?
If your circumstances or goals change (for example you’re nearing your first home purchase or retirement), you can review and adjust your risk level or switch investment style. Nutmeg allows you to change your settings and will rebuild your portfolio accordingly. It’s wise to speak with their guidance team if you’re unsure.
What is the benefit of starting investing early with Nutmeg?
Starting early gives you more time for compounding returns, lets you ride out short-term volatility, and allows you to align with a longer time-horizon which may justify taking slightly more risk. Nutmeg’s structure supports diversified portfolios that are designed for the long term. In addition, some account types (like Lifetime ISAs) offer government bonuses if used early.
How does Nutmeg’s relationship with J.P. Morgan add value?
Nutmeg is owned by J.P. Morgan Chase, and some investment styles (such as Smart Alpha and Income Investing) draw on the research and expertise of J.P. Morgan Asset Management.This linkage may provide access to deeper investment insights and institutional-level resources while maintaining the user-friendly digital interface.
How does tax relief work on pension contributions with Nutmeg?
When you contribute to a Nutmeg Personal Pension, the government adds tax relief automatically at the basic rate (20%) if you’re under age 75 and UK resident. For example: you contribute £8,000 net; the government adds £2,000, so the gross is £10,000. If you’re a higher-rate or additional-rate taxpayer, you may be able to claim further tax relief via your tax return. Keep in mind that the annual allowance (e.g., £60,000 or 100% of earnings, whichever is lower) applies and unused allowance from prior years may be carried forward subject to eligibility.
Can I transfer my existing pension pot to Nutmeg?
Yes — Nutmeg accepts transfers of many types of pensions into its Personal Pension product. Important considerations: You should check with your current pension provider whether there are exit or surrender charges or whether you’ll lose certain benefits upon transfer. For defined-benefit (DB) pensions over a certain value, you’ll need specialist financial advice before transferring. 

Typically takes ~2-3 weeks if electronic; can take longer depending on provider.”,
“What happens when I reach retirement age with my Nutmeg pension?”,
“When you reach the normal minimum pension age (currently 55, rising to 57 in 2028) you have several options with Nutmeg: You can stay invested and defer taking benefits.
You may take up to 25% of your pension pot as a tax-free lump sum (subject to allowances) and then move into drawdown or buy an annuity. With flexible access drawdown you can take withdrawals as needed; any portion over the tax-free part will be subject to income tax. If you withdraw the whole pot as cash, you’ll get the tax-free percentage followed by taxable income — but you should consider whether this leaves you with a sustainable income for later years.
What are the tax risks or things to watch when withdrawing from a Nutmeg pension?
Key things to watch: Although up to 25% of your pension pot may be tax-free, the remainder is taxed as income—which means the rate you pay depends on your total taxable income in that year. If you’ve started accessing your pension and triggered the Money Purchase Annual Allowance (MPAA), your future tax-relievable contributions may be reduced (currently £10,000). Transferring or withdrawing early (before your pension’s normal minimum age) could lead to heavy tax charges and loss of certain protections.
If I’m approaching a goal (like buying a house) and I have a Nutmeg portfolio, should I shift risk or style?
Yes, it’s prudent to revisit your risk profile and investment style as you approach a goal. For example: if your goal is near, you may want to reduce exposure to higher-volatility assets and shift to lower-risk or more stable styles. Nutmeg allows you to change your risk level or investment style through your account.
It’s also wise to ensure your investment time-horizon aligns with your goal—shorter horizon means less time to recover from market downturns.
How should I think about performance expectations with Nutmeg portfolios?
While Nutmeg builds globally diversified portfolios and uses investment expertise (including from J.P. Morgan), it emphasises that past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. Important points: Your outcome depends on how much you invest, how long you stay invested, your risk level, and how markets behave.
Because the portfolios include asset classes like equities, bonds, commodities and globally diversified ETFs, the returns will vary and have ups and downs.
Staying invested, rebalancing, and aligning your risk to your goals matter more than chasing high short-term returns.
What happens if I exceed the annual pension contribution allowance with Nutmeg?
If you exceed the annual allowance (typically £60,000 or 100% of your earnings, whichever is lower) when contributing to your pension via Nutmeg, you may incur a tax charge. For high earners, the allowance may be tapered. Also, if you’ve already started accessing pension benefits and triggered the MPAA, your allowance drops (to, e.g., £10,000) for future contributions.
Can I open multiple pots within Nutmeg for different goals and manage them separately?
Yes — you can use Nutmeg to open different investment “pots” or account types (e.g., Stocks & Shares ISA, Lifetime ISA, General Investment Account, personal pension) to target different goals (first home, retirement, children, etc.). You should align each pot’s time-horizon, risk level and style with the goal. Also, the fees and underlying investment styles can differ depending on which pot you're using.
What should I ask/consider before opening with Nutmeg or picking risk/style?
Here are important questions to ask yourself: What is my goal and time horizon? What is my risk appetite (how comfortable am I with potential losses)? Which investment style suits me (fully-managed, thematic, socially responsible, fixed allocation, income, etc.)? What fees am I paying (management fee + fund costs + spread)? How will I monitor performance and how often will the portfolio be rebalanced? What happens if I change my mind, want to withdraw, or want to transfer out later? Does my tax status or residency affect suitability (especially if living abroad)? Are there any exit/transfer charges, or what happens if I transfer my pension away? Answering these will help you choose the right setup with Nutmeg.
What are the implications of tax residency or moving abroad for my Nutmeg investments or pensions?
Tax residency and moving abroad can affect your investments and pensions with Nutmeg (and other providers). For example: Some products (ISAs) are only tax-efficient when you’re UK tax-resident; once you move abroad you may lose some tax benefits.
For pensions, transfers to overseas schemes can have tax implications—while Nutmeg allows UK pension transfers in-scheme, moving to another country may bring additional complexity (check with adviser). Always check with a tax adviser in your new country of residence and with Nutmeg about how your tax status affects your investment wrapper and benefits.
What happens to my pension with Nutmeg when I die?
If you hold a Nutmeg Personal Pension (a defined contribution scheme), what happens to the fund depends on your age at death, whether benefits have been taken, and who you nominate. For example: If you die before age 75, your remaining pension fund will generally pass to your nominated beneficiaries tax-free (if paid within two years of your death). If you die at or after age 75, your beneficiaries can still receive the remaining fund, but it will ordinarily be subject to income tax at their marginal rate. It’s important to keep your ‘expression of wishes’ (death nomination) up to date so your provider knows who you’d like your pension to go to.
Are the remaining investments in my Nutmeg ISA/Lifetime ISA affected when I die?
Yes. In the terms and conditions for Nutmeg ISAs and Lifetime ISAs:
On the death of an ISA investor, a surviving spouse or civil partner may have an additional “permitted subscription” allowance for their own ISA, but Nutmeg’s terms say they do not accept additional permitted subscriptions into a Nutmeg Lifetime ISA. For a Lifetime ISA (LISA), once you cease UK residency or die, that may affect eligibility for further contributions and the bonus.
What’s the difference between the SRI and Thematic investment styles at Nutmeg?
Here’s a comparison: Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) style: Focuses on companies with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials, while aiming for growth in a diversified portfolio. Thematic Investing style: Lets you pick a specific future-facing theme (for example, technological innovation, resource transformation, evolving consumer behaviour). The portfolio is tilted towards that theme but remains globally diversified. Thematic tends to carry higher risks (since you’re favouring a narrower theme) compared with SRI, which is more about integrating ESG across broad markets.
How does currency risk affect my Nutmeg portfolio when I invest globally?
When Nutmeg builds a globally diversified portfolio via ETFs, you’ll inevitably have exposure to assets denominated in different currencies (e.g., US dollar, euro). Currency risk means: If the foreign currency weakens relative to the pound sterling, your returns when converted back may be lower. Conversely, if that currency strengthens, you might benefit. Nutmeg emphasises global diversification and uses ETFs primarily to provide liquidity and cost-efficiency; currency risk is one of the many risks to be aware of alongside market risk and sector/geography risk.
If I’m non-UK resident, can I still invest with Nutmeg?
Nutmeg’s FAQ states that while they are primarily intended for UK residents, they do consider certain non-UK residents, especially if they hold a British passport and full UK bank account, and reside in one of the supported countries. However, changing tax/residency status may affect the tax-wrapper benefits (like ISAs, LISAs) and eligibility, so you should check your status and local tax implications carefully.
How do estate planning and inheritance tax (IHT) considerations tie in with my Nutmeg investments?
Important points for estate planning: Pensions (like a Nutmeg pension) are typically written in trust and so may fall outside your estate for inheritance tax purposes, provided the fund hasn’t been taken as cash and remains in the pension wrapper. Investments in ISAs, GIA (General Investment Account) or investment pots outside pension wrappers may form part of your estate and could be subject to IHT depending on your overall circumstances. Keeping your nominations up to date and being clear on how your investments will be distributed is key for estate planning.
What are the charges if I transfer multiple old pensions into my Nutmeg Personal Pension?
Nutmeg offers a service to consolidate old pensions into their Personal Pension. Key considerations: They state you can transfer many pension types, but defined benefit (DB) schemes with safeguarded benefits over £30,000 require specialist advice. While Nutmeg does not charge an exit fee for transferring out later, you should check any exit/exit charges from your old provider. As always with investing and pensions: “your capital is at risk” and past performance is not a guarantee.
What happens if I draw heavily from my pension and then my beneficiaries receive less when I die?
With a Nutmeg Personal Pension, the documentation states: If you draw a higher level of benefits (take large withdrawals or convert to an annuity with lower rate) that may reduce how much is left for your beneficiaries. It’s important to balance your income needs in retirement with leaving something for beneficiaries if that’s your goal.
What happens to my Nutmeg pot if I move abroad and change tax-residency?
Moving abroad can affect tax treatment of ISAs, pensions and investments. Nutmeg’s FAQs mention that for non-UK residents they consider applications in supported countries. However, key risks: ISAs may lose tax-wrapper status if you cease UK residency. Pensions may still be held, but contributions may no longer get UK tax relief, and withdrawals / inheritance may be taxed differently. If residency changes, local tax laws may supersede UK rules; always seek local tax advice.
How are the fund costs and portfolio management fees broken down in a Nutmeg pension?
From Nutmeg’s key features documents: The management fee for the pension (in the example) is 0.75% incl. VAT per year on the first £100,000 invested, and 0.35% incl. VAT on any amount above £100,000. On top of that, there are fund/ETF administration costs and market spread costs. The projected return illustration includes these costs. They emphasise that projections are not guaranteed and depends on your contributions, time-horizon, risk level and investment performance.
How does inflation affect my Nutmeg portfolio?
Inflation can erode the real value of cash and low-growth investments, so Nutmeg emphasises investing rather than ‘just parking money in cash’. Their guide explains that while higher savings rates may look tempting, staying in cash long term can risk losing purchasing power. For portfolios, Nutmeg notes that equities often have some ability to respond to inflation (companies may increase prices, grow revenues) but that this is not guaranteed and there are times when both equities and bonds fall.
What should I know about interest-rate changes and my Nutmeg investment?
Interest-rate rises and cuts influence many asset classes in your portfolio. For example, higher rates may reduce bond prices, impact borrowing costs for companies, and influence economic growth. Nutmeg’s 2025 outlook suggests central banks may cut rates gradually — which could mean bond prices rise and portfolios that include bonds might benefit. So while you don’t need to time the market, you should be aware that changing rate environments may affect performance and may prompt reviews of your risk/time-horizon settings.
How should I behave during market volatility when using Nutmeg?
Behavioural finance is a key part of Nutmeg’s guidance. They emphasise: Avoid letting emotions like fear or greed drive investment decisions. Many investors make the mistake of selling in downturns and missing the rebound. Nutmeg’s data shows that the vast majority of their clients did not change settings during major market stress events. Having a plan (goal, risk level, time horizon), and sticking to it, is more important than reacting to headlines.
If global growth is weak, how does that affect my Nutmeg portfolio?
Weak global growth can lower corporate profits, dampen equity returns, and make bond yields or credit spreads worse. According to Nutmeg’s outlook for 2025: they see risks in emerging markets (especially China) and higher equity valuations which may raise downside risk. They also emphasise that while diversification helps, there are no guarantees — all asset classes could be challenged at the same time.
Does having multiple goals and time-horizons matter with Nutmeg?
Yes — if you have different goals (e.g., short-term house purchase vs long-term retirement) they may require different portfolios. Time-horizon matters because you need to allow enough time to ride out market fluctuations. Nutmeg mentions that staying invested longer generally improves your chances of positive outcomes. If one of your goals is near, you might favour lower-risk or less volatile styles; if far away, you might accept more risk.
What about currency risk in my globally-diversified Nutmeg portfolio?
When you invest via Nutmeg, the portfolios are globally diversified — so you’ll have exposure to assets in different currencies. That means: If a foreign currency falls relative to the pound, your returns when converted may be lower. If it rises, you may benefit. Nutmeg notes that while global diversification is important, currency risk is one of the many risks to consider.
How might future tax changes affect investing through Nutmeg?
Tax regimes (e.g., pension allowances, ISA rules, capital gains, UK residency) can change over time, which may affect your net returns. Nutmeg’s guides remind investors that tax rules may change and depend on individual circumstances. One practical point: if tax relief or wrapper benefits (ISA, pension) change, the relative attractiveness of investing “wrapped” via Nutmeg vs other options may shift — so it’s worth reviewing periodically.
What behavioural biases should I watch out for when investing with Nutmeg?
Some common biases include: Loss aversion: the tendency to hold on to losing investments hoping for recovery. Confirmation bias: seeking only information that supports what you already believe. Herd behaviour: following popular trends without assessing fundamentals. Nutmeg’s advice: set your plan, align your risk/time horizon, and avoid frequent tinkering just because of market noise. 
If inflation is sticky and interest rates stay high, what does that mean for my portfolio with Nutmeg?
Sticky inflation means central banks could keep rates higher for longer, which may impact bonds (lower prices), equities (costs of business higher), and future returns. Nutmeg’s note on inflation and bonds states that in such an environment, yields may improve (so future returns from bond yields might be higher), but capital growth from bonds may be constrained until rates fall. So if you are in a low-risk portfolio (higher bond exposure), you should be aware that performance may differ from past low-rate environments and may require patience.
What should I ask myself if I’m nearing a goal and want to reduce risk with Nutmeg?
Here are useful questions: How many years remain until the goal? Would a market downturn significantly derail my target? Am I willing to accept less growth in return for less volatility? Should I switch to a lower risk level or a style with less equity exposure? Nutmeg emphasises that as time horizon shortens, risk tolerance may need to adjust and you may want to review your style/risk settings accordingly.
What should I do if I lose my job and have to pause contributions to my Nutmeg account?
If you experience a job loss or income reduction and need to pause contributions, Nutmeg’s guidance is: make sure your emergency savings are in place first; then review your investment goal, time-horizon and risk setting. Because Nutmeg emphasises “time in the market” not market timing, it’s generally better to stay invested rather than withdraw completely. If you reduce or stop contributions temporarily, make sure you keep your plans aligned and resume when circumstances permit. If your goal or timeframe has changed due to your job situation, you might revisit your risk level or style. Also, you can contact Nutmeg’s guidance team for a free call to discuss how to adjust your plan given your changed circumstances.
What if a market crash happens just before I’m due to buy my first home using a Nutmeg Lifetime ISA?
If you’re close to your goal (for example first home purchase) and the markets drop, then: Recognise that a crash means your portfolio value could be lower than you expected. Nutmeg’s volatility explanation suggests that if your time-horizon is short, you’ll feel the impact more. Consider reducing your risk level or switching to a more stable style so you’re not overly exposed to further market falls. You should engage with Nutmeg’s guidance team to review whether your goal timeframe, risk profile and style still fit your situation given the recent crash. Avoid panic-selling: Nutmeg emphasises that long-term investors benefit from staying invested rather than trying to time the market. In summary: you may need to revisit your plan and possibly accept less upside or more time until goal, but impulsively withdrawing may lock in the losses.
What happens if I retire early and want to start drawing from my Nutmeg pension, but the markets are weak?
If you retire early and need your pension earlier than expected, but markets are weak, then you face a few considerations: With a weaker-market entry point, your retirement pot may be smaller than anticipated, so you might need to adjust your income expectations or retirement age. You could consider gradually drawing rather than withdrawing all at once, so you don’t lock in losses during a downturn. Nutmeg emphasises the importance of aligning your investment strategy with your time horizon — in this case your time horizon for “growth before drawdown” shrinks when you retire early. Reach out to Nutmeg’s guidance team to review your pension options, risk level and drawdown strategy given the market conditions. In short: retiring early in a weak market is challenging, but reviewing your plan and staying flexible is key.
What if I create multiple pots in Nutmeg (for children, first home, retirement) and one of the goals becomes irrelevant — can I reallocate or repurpose that pot?
Yes you can manage multiple “pots” in Nutmeg for different goals (for example children’s education, first home, retirement). If one goal becomes irrelevant (say the first home plan is cancelled), you should: Review whether the pot still fits your revised goal in terms of risk level, time-horizon, style. You may repurpose the pot — e.g., shift it into a longer-term goal like retirement, and possibly adjust risk to match the new horizon. Check for any tax-wrapper issues (for example with LISAs or ISAs) before changing the goal because some wrappers have restrictions. Contact Nutmeg guidance to help you decide whether repurposing is appropriate given your new circumstances. This flexibility means you’re not locked into a goal; what matters is aligning risk, time-horizon and style with the actual objective.
What if global instability (geopolitical conflict, tariffs, pandemic) causes drawdowns — how does Nutmeg respond, and what should I do?
If global instability causes market drawdowns, Nutmeg’s investment team explains: They monitor macro events (such as tariffs or political shocks) and may adjust portfolios (for example reducing equity exposure) to manage risk. Portfolios are globally diversified across asset classes, which helps cushion the impact of one region’s instability. From your side, you should: Remember that fluctuations are part of investing; the longer your horizon, the more time to recover. Avoid making impulsive changes (e.g., switching out of your plan entirely) unless your goal, time-horizon, or risk tolerance have meaningfully changed. If you’re concerned about your risk profile given the instability, book a free call with Nutmeg’s guidance team to review your plan. In summary: Nutmeg responds to instability with diversification and monitoring; you respond by staying aligned with your time-horizon and risk setting rather than reacting emotionally.
